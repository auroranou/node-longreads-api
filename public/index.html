		<h1>Longreads REST API</h1>
		<p>Longreads aggregates long-form fiction and non-fiction articles from around the world. This API theoretically provides programmatic access to read <a href="http://longreads.com/">Longreads</a> data.</p>
		<p>Responses are available in JSON. Article records are structured in the following format:</p>
		<p class='code'>
			{<br>
				<em>title:</em> string,<br>
				<em>articleUrl:</em> string,<br>
				<em>author:</em> string,<br>
				<em>source:</em> string,<br>
				<em>pubDate:</em> string,<br>
				<em>minuteLength:</em> integer,<br>
				<em>wordLength:</em> string<br>
			}
		</p>
